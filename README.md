# HIGH-LEVEL APPROACH:
This problem essentially involves implementing the TCP/IP layer of the Internet protocol stack that is otherwise implemented by the OS. The program called "rawhttpget" that takes a URL on the command line and then downloads the file. On a high level, we created two sockets, one for receiving and one for sending. Then we created a TCP and IP header and then wrote code for establishing a connection, i.e, the three-way handshake. Once that's done, we send a GET request to the server and then receive all the TCP segments with the data from the server. We put these segments into an OrderedDict. For each data segment, we send an ACK back to the server. Once all the data is the received, the server sends a FIN/PSH/ACK, to which we reply with a FIN/ACK, and finally receive a final ACK from the server, thus closing the connection. Then we write the bytes collected in an OrderedDict into a file. 

# TCP/IP FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- IP features implemented : Validating checksums of packets, packet forwarding and receiving, setting correct version, header length and total length, protocol identifier and checksum in each outgoing packet.
- TCP features implemented : Verifing checksums of incoming packets, generating correct checksum for outgoing packets, performing three-way handshake with server, correctly handling connection teardown, correctly handling sequence and acknowledgment numbers, using advertised window, implementing timeouts, discarding duplicate packets, implementing congestion control using cwnd.

# CHALLENGES:
We faced the following challenges:
1. Checksum offloading had to be disabled because we were not getting the right packet-trace on comparing with wget response.
2. Faced challenges in the TCP handshake, we had to fix issues where we were calculating the wrong checksum and not receving SYN/ACK from server.
3. Receiving retransmissions from the server, as TCP segments receieved weren't ACK-ed properly. Fixed this issue by going over concepts of TCP ACKs again.
4. Code didn't run for 10MB and 50MB initially as window size was small and giving an error. Fixed this by fixing the TCP window size. 
5. Faced challenges with the VM which slowed down our development process but we still managed to collaborate effectively, and fix the issue.

# OVERVIEW OF TESTING:
- Used Wireshark to compare the packet traced from wget and our program.
- For making sure that the file downlaoded was correct, we used a hashing algorithm (md5sum) to compare the wget file and the file generated by our code.  

# DISTRIBUTION OF TASKS:
Both teammates actively collaborated to discuss the approach needed to solve the problem. Additionally, 
both teammates collaborated with each other to help debug issues. During collaboration, Farida worked on creating TCP and IP headers and sending the packets, Arvind worked on receiving the data from the server and unpacking the headers. The remaining work was done by programming together.
